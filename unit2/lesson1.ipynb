    "Unlike languages that you may be used to, such as Python, Node.JS and JavaScript have 3 types of variables: `var`, `let`, and `const`. `let` and `const` are more specific types of the generic variable declaration `var`. Any data type can be stored in any variable, however, they are all slightly different. Let's take a look at these differences. \n"
